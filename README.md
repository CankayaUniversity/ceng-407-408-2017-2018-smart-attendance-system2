Installation Guide for Smart Attendance System
In our project, we have both an IOS application for students and a web application for the lecturers.
For our IOS Application:
1.Before you begin, you need a few things set up in your environment:
•	Xcode 8.0 or later
•	An Xcode project targeting iOS 8 or above
•	Swift projects must use Swift 3.0 or later
•	The bundle identifier of your app

2.Add Firebase to your app
It's time to add Firebase to your app. To do this you'll need a Firebase project and a Firebase configuration file for your app.
2.1	Create a Firebase project in the Firebase console, if you don't already have one. If you already have an existing Google project associated with your mobile app, click Import Google Project. Otherwise, click Add project.
2.2	Click Add Firebase to your iOS app and follow the setup steps. If you're importing an existing Google project, this may happen automatically and you can just download the config file.
2.3	When prompted, enter your app's bundle ID. It's important to enter the bundle ID your app is using; this can only be set when you add an app to your Firebase project.
2.4	At the end, you'll download a GoogleService-Info.plist file. You can download this file again at any time.
2.5	 If you haven't done so already, add this file to your Xcode project root using the Add Files utility in Xcode (From the File menu, click Add Files). Make sure the file is included in your app's build target.
3.  Downloading the source codes and open the application from the Github.

4. File->Open->Directory that our source codes are placed->Select the file. 

5. Make a connection between your Iphone and your Mac with a cable then run our code in xcode.

For our Web Application:

1.Before you begin, you need a few things set up in your environment:
•	Visual studio 2012 or later
•	Windows operating system
•	Any web browser
2. Add our codes to your visual studio then run our code.
